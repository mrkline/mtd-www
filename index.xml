	<h2>Design aims</h2>
	<p>We're working on a generic Linux subsystem for memory devices,
	especially Flash devices.</p>
	<p>The aim of the system is to make it simple to provide a driver for new
	hardware, by providing a generic interface between the hardware drivers
	and the upper layers of the system.
	</p>
	<p>Hardware drivers need to know nothing about the storage formats used,
	  such as FTL, FFS2, etc., but will only need to provide simple routines
	  for <tt>read</tt>, <tt>write</tt> and <tt>erase</tt>.
	Presentation of the device's contents to the user in an appropriate form
	will be handled by the upper layers of the system.
	</p>
