<h2><a name="L_ubifs_compr">UBIFS compression experiments on ARM platform</a></h2>

<p>This section contains the results of our compression experiments on an ARM
platform with 256MiB OneNAND flash. Please, bear in mind that the results are
specific to our platform and may be different for other platforms. Flash I/O
speed, CPU speed, CPU architecture and contents of the test files greatly
affect the results. Please, take this into account before extrapolating our
test results to your system.</p>

<p>UBIFS supports LZO and zlib
<a href="../doc/ubifs.html#L_compression">compressors</a> and the
<code>mkfs.ubifs</code> tool supports
<a href="../faq/ubifs.html#L_favor_lzo">favor LZO</a> compression method. We
tried to figure out what is the preferred compression type for our system, and
the results of our experiments are below.</p>

<p>This table contains the results of 3 separate tests.</p>
<ol>
	<li>Read test, where we measured read speed of a 98.2MiB file. The file
	contained various ARM libraries, executables from <code>/bin</code> and
	<code>/sbin</code>, and files from <code>/etc</code>. We created
	UBIFS images containing only this single file using using the
	<code>mkfs.ubifs</code> utility with various compression options. Then
	we measured read speed by reading whole 98.2MiB file on our ARM
	platform. So,
	<ul>
		<li>1st column names the compressors and
		<code>mkfs.ubifs</code> options;</li>

		<li>2nd column lists file read speed;</li>

		<li>3rd column lists file read speed as percent of the
		uncompressed file read speed
		([<i>read_speed</i>/25.81]*100%);</li>

		<li>4th column lists resulting UBIFS image sizes;</li>

		<li>5th column lists image sizes as percent of the
		uncompressed image size ([<i>image_size</i>/98.2MiB]*100%).</li>
	</ul></li>

	<li>Write speed test, where we wrote the same 98.2MiB file and
	synchronized the file system. And since favor LZO is
	<code>mkfs.ubifs</code>-only feature, it could not be tested, so

	<ul>
		<li>6th column lists write speed.</li>
	</ul></li>

	<li>Rootfs image compression test, where we generated UBIFS image
	containing our root file system and compared resulting image sizes. So
	<ul>
		<li>7th column lists sizes of our ARM rootfs images;</li>
		<li>8th column lists rootfs image sizes in percent of
		uncompressed rootfs image size
		([<i>image_size</i>/301.8MiB]*100%).</li>
	</ul></li>
</ol>

<p>UBIFS was mounted with "<code>bulk_read</code>" and
"<code>no_chk_data_crc</code>"
<a href="../doc/ubifs.html#L_mountopts">mount options.</a></p>

<p>The last row of the table contains the results of experimenting with JFFS2
zlib initialization parameters
(see <a href="../doc/ubifs.html#L_compression">here</a>) which are different to
UBIFS compression parameters. We just temporarily hacked UBIFS and
<code>mkfs.ubifs</code> to carry out the experiment.</p>

<p>As you may see from the table, zlib  considerably slower on both
compressing and decompressing comparing to LZO, while compression ratio only
slightly better. You may also see that the favor LZO method may be used to
balance speed and compression ratio, although the kernel is unable to write
using favor LZO method (well, it'd be  easy to implement this but write
speed would drop a lot because the kernel would have to compress everything
using both compressors). And because for our system the performance was more
important, we selected LZO compressor.</p>



<h2><a name="L_ubifs_large_compr">UBIFS large block compression tests</a></h2>

<p>UBIFS (just like JFFS2) compresses 4KiB data blocks, which means that all
data is split on 4KiB chunks, and each chunk is compressed independently.
Obviously, UBIFS could provide better compression if it used larger compression
chunks, e.g. 8KiB or 16KiB. Implementing this would be difficult, but
possible. But we tried to estimate how much of the improvement that would
be and did the following:</p>

<ul>
	<li>gacked the <code>mkfs.ubifs</code> utility and made it generate
	UBIFS images with large compression chunk sizes - 8KiB, 16KiB, 32KiB and
	so on; <a href="mkfs.ubifs-comp.diff">here</a> is the patch which
	implements the hack;</li>

	<li>generated UBIFS images of our root file-system with various
	compression chunk sizes; the root file system was ARM rootfs and
	contained Debian-based <a href="http://maemo.org">Maemo</a> stuff;</li>

	<li>generated UBIFS images with both LZO and zlib compressors with
	4KiB-256KiB compression chunk sizes.</li>
</ul>

<p>The following table contains the results for LZO compressor.</p>

<p>The "decrease" column contains image size improvements comparing to the
previous image, and the "absolute decrease" column contains image size
improvements comparing to the standard image with 4KiB compression chunk
size.</p>

<p>As you can see, LZO gives better improvement comparing to zlib when
compression chunk size grows. Also, LZO with 32KiB compression chunk gives the
same result as zlib with standard 4KiB compression chunk size, so it is
questionable whether it makes sense to use the former. This depends on large
compression chunks I/O speed penalty, but we do not have any numbers for
this.</p>

<p>Thus, we figured out that large compression chunks support does not give
much benefits <b>for our</b> system and did not implement this feature in
UBIFS. However, for other systems this could give better improvements.</p>
