	<H2>MTD GIT HOWTO</H2>

<P>The MTD GIT tree is at <TT>git://git.infradead.org/linux-mtd.git</TT>,
and is visible through <A
HREF="http://git.infradead.org/?p=linux-mtd.git">gitweb</A>. Other git
trees are available and can be browsed through the gitweb interface 
at <A HREF="http://git.infradead.org/">http://git.infradead.org/</A>.
</P>

<P>Users with accounts on git.infradead.org (aka bombadil.infradead.org)
can create their own git trees which are publicly accessible. A cron
job runs every five minutes, indexing the available trees in users' 
<TT>~/public_git/</TT> directories and making them available in
gitweb.</P>
<P>When creating GIT trees with patches you intend to be pushed upstream,
please try to ensure that we end up with as few merges as possible.
Anything you commit should be on top of the latest linux-mtd git tree,
rather than against a clean tree from Linus. Avoid doing any merges of
your own, unless absolutely necessary.</P>

<P>Please try to avoid cloning a full tree directly from git.infradead.org --
you'll be downloading many thousands of objects which are already
present in the official upstream source tree. Save your disk space and
our network bandwidth by using 'alternates' instead. This is what the
'<TT>--reference</TT>' command in the examples below is for. It means
that you keep only one copy of all the git objects which exist in
the 'reference' or 'alternate' tree, rather than duplicating them.</P>

<H3>Creating your own tree on git.infradead.org</H3>

Creating your own tree is simple. You create a <TT>public_git</TT>
directory within your home directory, and ensure that it is world-readable:
<PRE>
$ ssh bombadil.infradead.org
$ mkdir ~/public_git
$ chmod og+rx ~ ~/public_git
</PRE>

Once you've done that, you can create trees in your <TT>public_git</TT>
directory by cloning from the existing trees which are in <TT>/srv/git</TT>
(or indeed from other users' trees):

<PRE>
$ cd ~/public_git
$ git clone -l -n -s --bare /srv/git/linux-mtd.git foo.git
$ echo 'this is my tree for playing with foobar' &amp;gt; foo.git/description
</PRE>

<P>Your new tree will be immediately accessible to the public through the
URL <TT>git://git.infradead.org/~&lt;I&gt;user&lt;/I&gt;/foo.git</TT>.
</P>
<P>Within five minutes of its creation, your tree should be visible 
through the <A HREF="http://git.infradead.org/">gitweb</A> interface
  too.</P>
<P>You can then make a local clone of your public tree (as shown below),
make commits to it and push them back. For this, use the URL
<TT>ssh://git.infradead.org/~/public_git/foo.git</TT>.</P>

<P><I>Note: The git d&amp;aelig;mon exports each user's <TT>public_git</TT> directory as 
   <TT>git://git.infradead.org/~<I>user</I></TT> &amp;mdash; just as httpd would
   export their <TT>public_html</TT> directory as
   <TT>http://bar.infradead.org/~<I>user</I></TT>. So be aware that 
   when using <TT>ssh://</TT> URLs, you must specify the <TT>public_git</TT>
   part of the path, as shown in the example above.</I></P>

<H3>Working with your GIT tree</H3>

<H4>Clone Linus' tree</H4>
If you don't already have a copy of Linus' tree locally, get one:
<PRE>$ git clone git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git linux</PRE>

<H4>Clone MTD tree</H4>
Using Linus' tree as a reference for existing objects, clone the MTD
  tree:
<PRE>$ git clone --reference linux git://git.infradead.org/linux-mtd.git linux-mtd</PRE>

<H4>Clone your own tree</H4>
Now using the MTD tree as a reference for existing objects, clone your
own tree from your <TT>public_git</TT> directory:
<PRE>$ git clone --reference linux-mtd ssh://git.infradead.org/~/public_git/foo.git myfoo</PRE>

Having cloned your tree, you can now commit to it using git-commit
and push the results back with git-push.
<H4>Keeping branches in your own tree</H4>
<P>
In general, I would advise that you avoid branches; especially on the server
&amp;mdash; it's easy enough just to create new trees instead, and
much less complicated to deal with.</P>
<P>However, it <em>is</em> useful to
keep a 'branch' in your tree for each upstream repository that you
pull from. The <TT>linux-mtd.git</TT> tree has such a branch called
'linus' which shows the last merge from Linus' master kernel tree,
thus allowing operations like <TT>git-diff linus..</TT> to work
easily, and helping the the script which feeds the commits list to
exclude commits which came from upstream repositories.
</P>
<P>You may find it useful to keep similar '<TT>linus</TT>' and
'<TT>mtd</TT>' branches in your own tree. This used to be relatively
simple, but I don't actually know how to set up current versions of
git to do it so I won't attempt to explain it here.</P>
